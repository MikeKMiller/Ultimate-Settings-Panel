# Ultimate-Settings-Panel
# History
Ultimate Settings Panel was a C# learning project that just expanded into a popular download, but the code is very basic and in some places, a bit of mess! I have not got the time to work on this project any longer so hoping that releasing the source code to the community will mean that the code can be optimised and the utility enhanced with new and better features.
# Features
The features that it has at the moment are that you can use it to open a wide range of Windows settings across a number of tabs. You can change the theme and colour layout and it will save these settings on exit. That is about it. I've been asked to add things like drag and drop and hidding unwanted tabs - but never got round to it.
# Design and Layout
The utility uses C# and has the Metro Framework for the design and layout.
